ubuntu-nginx-lucee
==================

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/foundeo/ubuntu-nginx-lucee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/foundeo/ubuntu-nginx-lucee) -->

A set of bash scripts for standing up a Lucee server using nginx and Tomcat on Ubuntu. Uses the
Tomcat from the Ubuntu distribution so you can update Tomcat using `apt-get update tomcat8`

<!-- *Important:* The master branch is now using Lucee 5, for Lucee 4.5 see the [lucee45-ubuntu14](https://github.com/foundeo/ubuntu-nginx-lucee/tree/lucee45-ubuntu14) branch. -->

Why would I use this instead of the offical Lucee installers?
-------------------------------------------------------------

* You want to run nginx as your web server
* You want to update Tomcat via `apt-get`

What does it do?
----------------

1. **Updates Ubuntu** - simply runs `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade`
2. **Downloads Lucee** - uses curl to download lucee jars from BitBucket places jars in `/opt/lucee/current/`
3. **Installs & Configures Tomcat 8** - runs `apt-get install tomcat8` updates the `web.xml` `server.xml` and `catalina.properties` to configure Lucee servlets and mod_cfml Valve.  (Tomcat/Lucee run on port 8080 by default).
4. **Installs Oracle JVM** - if you downloaded a server-jre and specified its path in the config it will extract it under `/opt/lucee/jvm/version` and then create a symbolic link `/opt/lucee/jvm/current` to denote the current jvm version to use. It also edits tomcat config to point to this jvm. You can also use OpenJDK instead.
5. **Installs & Configures nginx** - runs `apt-get install nginx` to install nginx. Crates a web root directory. Creates a `lucee.config` file so you can just `include lucee.config` for any site that uses CFML
6. **Set Default Lucee Admin Password** - uses cfconfig to set the Lucee server context password and default web context password. If environment variable ADMIN_PASSWORD exists that is used, otherwise a random password is set.  

Take a look in the `scripts/` subfolder to see the script for each step.

How do I run it?
----------------

1. **Downlaod this repository** - `curl -Lo /root/ubuntu-nginx-lucee.tar.gz https://api.github.com/repos/rawdyn/ubuntu-nginx-lucee/tarball/master`
2. **Extract repository** - `tar -xzvf /root/ubuntu-nginx-lucee.tar.gz`
3. **Optional: Download Oracle JVM** - Traditionally the Oracle JVM is used to run CFML applications. You can instead use the open source OpenJDK (which the Oracle JVM is based on). The advantage of using OpenJDK is that you can also keep it up to date using `apt-get`. The advantage of the Oracle JVM is that it includes a few Java classes that might be used for image processing (eg the com.sun classes). If you download a JVM from Oracle make sure the jvm you downloaded is located in the folder that contains install.sh, eg `/root/foundeo-ubuntu-nginx-lucee-abcdefg/`. If you skip this step OpenJDK is used instead.
4. **Configuration** - You can either Edit the `install.sh` and change any configuration options such as the Lucee Version or JVM version - or you can use environment variables (see below).
5. **Run install.sh** - make sure you are root or sudo and run `./install.sh` you may need to `chmod u+x install.sh` to give execute permissions to the script.


Limitations / Known Issues
--------------------------

* The servlet definitions and mappings (located in `/etc/tomcat8/web.xml`) are slimmed down, so if you need things like REST web services, flash/flex remoting support see the [Railo docs for web.xml config](https://github.com/getrailo/railo/wiki/Configuration:web.xml)
* The `/lucee/` uri is blocked in `/etc/nginx/lucee.conf` you must add in your ip address and restart nginx.
* There is no uninstall option
* This version of the script has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS only

Environment Variables
--------------------------

The script can be configured with the following environment variables:

* `LUCEE_VERSION` - sets the version of Lucee that it will attempt to install (eg 5.2.4.37).
* `JVM_MAX_HEAP_SIZE` - sets the amount of memory that java / tomcat can use (eg 512m).
* `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - sets the Lucee server context password and default web context password. If variable is not defined a random password is generated and set.
* `JVM_FILE` - the name of a Oracle server-jre file if not found will use OpenJDK instead (eg server-jre-8u152-linux-x64.tar.gz)
* `JVM_VERSION` - the version string corresponding to the JVM_FILE (eg 1.8.0_152)
* `WHITELIST_IP` - if specified this IP will be whitelisted to allow access to /lucee/
* `LUCEE_JAR_SHA256` - if specified checks the sha256sum of the the downloaded lucee.jar

Setting up a Virtual Host
-------------------------

By default nginx on Ubuntu looks in the folder `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` for configuration nginx files. To setup a site create a file in that folder (another technique you can use is to create the file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and then create a symbolic link in sites-enabled to enable the site), for example `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/me.example.com.conf` at a minimum it will look like this:

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name me.example.com;
		root /web/me.example.com/wwwroot/;
		include lucee.conf;
	}

You may also want to break logging for this site out into its own file, like this:

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name me.example.com;
		root /web/me.example.com/wwwroot/;
		access_log /var/log/nginx/me.example.com.access.log;
		error_log /var/log/nginx/me.example.com.error.log;
		include lucee.conf;
	}

If you don't need Lucee/CFML for a given site, simply omit the `include lucee.conf;` line, like this:

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name img.example.com;
		root /web/img.example.com/wwwroot/;
	}

Create the symbolic link in sites-enabled to enable the site:

	sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/me.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

After making changes you need to restart or reload nginx:

	sudo service nginx restart
